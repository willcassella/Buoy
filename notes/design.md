So how is the UI constructed?
- Parents push/pop widgets
- One widget doesn't necessarily correspond to a single element
    - Problem: It's a little bit wierd how the widget function is given a size boundary, when that size boundary won't necessarily apply to the layout it adds
    - So why am I splitting things up like this?
        - Widgets should follow "referential transparency"
            - Meaning a widget that directly pushes several layouts should be equivalent to pushing several widgets that each push a single layout
- So a widget can do the following:
    - Push a widget filter (callback for widgets that get pushed)
    - Push a bounds (used for widgets that get pushed)
    - Push a layout (gets called with final coordinates and size)
        - Should pushing a layout also require passing layout bounds?
